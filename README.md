Portfolio site scaffold

Files created:
- index.html (original file exists; a full scaffold was prepared but not applied due to editor tool limits)
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- assets/project1.svg
- assets/project2.svg
- assets/project3.svg

Quick run:

Open the site in a browser:

- Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.

Or serve locally (recommended):

Python 3:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

Next steps:
- Review the new scaffold and confirm you want `index.html` replaced in-place.
- Replace placeholder content (your name, bio, project links, images).
- I can apply the full `index.html` scaffold in-place if you approve.
